4. Design Concepts
The Quick Mart interface is built around a clean, minimalist, and very interactive user interface. It follows modern mobile UI/UX guidelines, with emphasis on clarity, ease of navigation, and efficiency in user interaction.

4.1 UI Design
The visual components are designed in Figma with a light color palette and bold, readable typography. The layout relies on a bottom tab navigation bar with four main icons: Discover, Favorites, Cart, and Profile. Each screen is spaced for touch-friendly navigation and is optimized for both small and large mobile screens.


4.2 UX Flow

On Launch: Users are presented with a loading screen displaying the app logo.
Discover Flow: Users scroll or swipe through available shoes. Swiping left dismisses and swipes it out of the cart, and swiping right in pulls it into the cart.
Search Flow: A search bar allows users to find specific shoes by name.
Favorites Flow: Items marked as favorite are stored for future reference and accessible on a dedicated page.
Cart and Checkout Flow: Multiple selected items are shown with individual and total prices. Checkout prompts authentication if the user isn't logged in.
Authentication Flow: New users can create accounts with email and password, while returning users can log in. Once signed in, users can access their profile and settings.

4.3 Responsiveness & Accessibility

Responsive Layout: Components resize smoothly to fit various device sizes.
Touch Optimization: Interactions and buttons are all optimized for tap accuracy and thumb reach.
Accessible Fonts and Contrast: Offers readability and usability for people with visual impairments.
